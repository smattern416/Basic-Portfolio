                <p class=bio>Heyo my name is Stephanie Mattern. I was born and raised here in Orlando, did my undergrad in Tampa at USF and then moved out to the Mile High city for 5 1/2 years. I am obsessed with my dog, Tylie, who is a 15 year old Cockapoo. I really enjoy spending time with my family & friends, eating really good food, fashion and British procedurals.
                    <br>
                    Another passion of mine is travel. I studied abroad in Italy while I was in college and fell in love with traveling. My interests and passions are a huge reason for me taking this bootcamp and pursuing this new career. I want a career that allows me the option to work remotely (while abroad) and provides more time for the good stuff in life. 
                    <br>
                    I'm looking forward to learning about this entirely new world of web development and all of the opportunities ahead.</p>
